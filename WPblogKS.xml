                <![CDATA[<p>On November 16 I started the ninth week at <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com/" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a>. I completed the assigned screens, and did some pair programming on the doctor screens. When we had all the basic screens done, we started to work on the automatic appointment scheduler part of the application. As this was a complex module that needed to apply several rules in order to determine which doctor to schedule for a checked-in patient, we applied mob programming and were able to break down the problem and write the code to implement it in the application back end.</p><p>After we had completed the code for the appointment scheduler, Cameron suggested that we should write some test methods for it, rather than simply plugging it into the front end and then playing around with the application to test it.</p><p>This was not only an opportunity to work more with writing test methods, but also we learned from Cameron how to create an in-memory test double of the Entity Framework database, and inject that database context into the test methods (a great example of dependency injection!), so that we could avoid using the real database for our test methods. To create the test database context, we used the techniques discussed <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/dn314431.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p>It is much better to have a test database that mocks the real database for test methods; we had been writing test methods that use the real database, which meant that a test method had to delete any test objects that it created, and if a test method failed, it was necessary to delete the test objects manually, via SQL server or the front end. Although implementing the test database took quite a bit of code, it was worth it.</p><p>We also learned how to use load masks in the front end, so that while a table is loading, a spinner is shown to indicate to the user that the loading is being performed, and they need to wait for it to complete. It was good that rather than having to spend time figuring out how to write a spinner in HTML/CSS/Javascript, we could use the pre-existing <a href="http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-spinner" target="_blank">angular spinner</a>. It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want the challenge of writing an animated spinner, it&#8217;s just that if we take time to write every detail that we need, then we have less time for other parts of the project. That&#8217;s why learning to code also consists of knowing how to use pre-existing components such as <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, that help you get your website up and running faster.</p><p>By the end of the week, we were almost finished with the group project, and over the weekend we will do individual work on various features that need to be completed.</p><p>I also had the opportunity to do a presentation this week on Test-Driven Development (TDD) at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Origin-Code-Academy-Meetup/" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy meetup</a>. TDD is a software development method that consists of short cycles with the following phases:</p><ul><li>Red: Write a test for a feature that does not yet exist, therefore the test fails.</li><li>Green: Write the minimum code necessary to make the test pass.</li><li>Refactor: Clean up/reorganize the code.</li></ul><p>The above cycle is repeated until all the features have been added. The TDD approach results in a complete collection of tests for each feature, and tight efficient code that contains only the necessary code for each feature.</p><p>My presentation included a demonstration of TDD with a simple example of a Calculator class with methods for adding, subtracting, etc. My lovely assistant Adriann stood with me for the presentation, and ran the demo with me, so that we could demonstrate ping-pong pair programming in TDD. This meant that first I wrote a failing test (red phase), then Adriann wrote the minimum code needed to make the test pass (green phase), and then I cleaned up the code (refactor phase). In the next cycle, Adriann wrote the failing test, and then I made it pass, and so on.</p><p>By the way, I don&#8217;t know if there is a saying that if a demo can go wrong, it will, but there should be a saying like that! Yes, of course there was a problem with the demo, and luckily Cameron jumped in to help it get back on track.</p><p>One of the most interesting parts about the presentation was that I actually received quite a few questions about testing in general, so I had the opportunity to explain the importance of unit testing, and having a collection of tests that can be automatically run for an application.</p><p>We had two guest speakers this week. The first was Abinathab John Roy Bennet, senior program manager at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> in Seattle. He has extensive developer experience and only recently made the change to be a program manager, so he had some good advice for us.</p><p>The second speaker was Mike Glanz, CEO and co-founder of <a href="http://www.hireahelper.com" target="_blank">Hire A Helper</a>. He talked about what junior developers need to do to prove to prospective employers that it is worth it to hire them, and gave us a lot of food for thought.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/99/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/99/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=99&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>November 9 was the start of the eighth week in coding bootcamp. This week we were assigned a medical scheduling application as a group project. We used <a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/agile-project-management-for-dummies-cheat-sheet.html" target="_blank">Agile project management</a>, with a <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>board to implement <a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum" target="_blank">Scrum</a>. This means using an efficient software development methodology to break down a complex software system into more manageable components, and analyze the process continuously to find ways of improving it.</p><p>Basically, the medical scheduling application contains exam rooms, and doctors and patients who check in. When a doctor checks in, that doctor becomes available for appointments. When a patient checks in, the system automatically assigns an appointment to that patient with a checked-in doctor and an available exam room. Our first task for the group project was to analyze the user stories that our teacher had placed on the project backlog on the Trello board. (A user story describes something that a user would like to be able to do with the system.) After understanding what the application would need to do, we decided what database tables would be needed, and what Web screens would be needed. We put each of these components on a card on the project backlog, decided what the estimated effort was, and then planned the first sprint, which included creating the SQL database tables via Entity Framework code first, and writing a Web API for each table. The Web APIs needed to include unit tests, so that every time we made a change we could run all the unit tests to check that everything was still working.</p><p>Then it was time for us to do mob programming! Mob programming is a technique where one person sits at the computer keyboard, and the rest of the team collaborate to tell the keyboarder what to input. This helps to keep everybody involved in the project details, and harnesses everybody&#8217;s brainpower to tackle the problem and come up with a solution. We used mob programming to set up the Web API project with Entity Framework to define the database tables and generate the database. This took a few iterations before we successfully generated the database, as we needed to precisely specify the primary key and foreign key relationships between the various tables in order for the generation to work. Then we continued with mob programming to write the Web API controllers for the doctor database table, including the unit tests, as not everybody in the class was familiar with writing unit tests. Unit tests for Web APIs are somewhat complex, as it is necessary to first verify that the result is the expected HTTP status code, and then it is necessary to extract the content from the HTTP result body in order to verify that it is the correct content.</p><p>Once we had the first Web API controller done, we split up the other Web controllers. I was assigned the patient database table controllers; I also did some pair programming on the doctor check-in controllers. For the patient controllers, when I got to the delete patient method, I wondered if deleting a patient record meant also deleting any corresponding records in other tables, such as appointments or check-ins for that patient. In a group discussion, we realized that instead of removing a patient from the database, we needed to archive the patient, and we needed to do the same for doctors. This meant that we needed to add an archived indicator to the patient and doctor tables, which gave us the opportunity to learn about using Entity Framework migration to modify an existing database.</p><p>This group project also gave us the opportunity to practice <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> workflow, which involves a master branch containing production code that has been verified as working, and then each of us creates a branch for the feature that we are writing. When the new feature has been verified to work, the feature branch is merged with the master branch. There was a bit of a learning curve where we had to learn how to handle merge conflicts, but we got the hang of it.</p><p>It was a great feeling to move the cards on the Trello board from current sprint to done, as we completed the Web API controllers. Once that sprint was done, we planned the next sprint, which would include the Web screens, implemented as a single-page application and built with <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. I took the administration screens for my assignment, as they involved using <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router" target="_blank">Angular UI router</a> and tabs to move to different screens, and I wanted to learn how to use the tabs. I had to struggle a bit, but I got the tabs working, which was a feeling of accomplishment for me.</p><p>This past week I also improved my <a href="https://portfolium.com/" target="_blank">Portfolium</a> entry by adding some class projects, and then I was notified that my ChipotleMapper project was a staff pick and would be featured on the main <a href="https://portfolium.com/" target="_blank">Portfolium</a> discover page! I guess the staff really likes Mexican food!</p><p>The guest speaker this week was Justin Mealey, a very knowledgeable software developer who is also the CEO of <a href="http://pleenq.com" target="_blank">Pleenq</a>, a company that provides the capability to link to a Website from any part of an image on a Web page. He gave us a coding exercise that involved using the <a href="http://www.createjs.com/easeljs" target="_blank">EaselJS</a> framework to highlight an image and then click the highlighting to link to a Website. This was a challenge, to learn a framework that I had never used before, and try to understand how to use it to accomplish a task. I was able to complete the task partially but not completely in the allotted time; actually nobody in the class completed it, although some came close. It was a useful exercise to try to learn a new tool and understand how to use it, just from reading the documentation and playing around with the tool.</p><p>Finally, yesterday I attended <a href="http://coderetreat.org/events/global-day-of-code-retreat-san-diego-ca-hosted-by-pluralsight" target="_blank">Code Retreat</a>, hosted by <a href="https://preview.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank">Pluralsight</a>. This event was described in the email that I first received about it as a &#8220;<span class="s1">day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design&#8221;. It certainly sounded like it would be worth it to devote an entire Saturday to it, and it was! I had the opportunity to talk to software developers, and practice test-driven development with pair programming and mob programming to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway&#8217;s Game of Life</a> (it&#8217;s not the board game!).</span></p><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/81/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/81/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=81&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>On November 2, I began the seventh week at <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Coding Academy</a>. Hard to believe the first half of coding bootcamp was over, and I was starting the second half! In the beginning of the week, I learned more about passing information to the different states of a single-page application, and also learned how to use the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource" target="_blank">AngularJS $resource</a> factory to simplify access to the PropertyManager API, resulting in much less code than I had needed in <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html" target="_blank">KnockoutJS</a> to access an API. The <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngResource/service/$resource" target="_blank">$resource</a> factory can be used only with <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/REST" target="_blank">RESTful APIs</a>, and luckily the APIs that I write in this course are <a href="http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/REST" target="_blank">RESTful</a>. After that I was able to complete the front end of the PropertyManager Web application, including showing all properties, tenants, and leases, along with the functionality to add and update each.</p><p>Then I started earning about authentication and authorization, which is a huge topic that can&#8217;t be completely learned in one week, but it is possible to get some understanding of the subject. I was assigned the tutorials <a href="http://bitoftech.net/2014/06/01/token-based-authentication-asp-net-web-api-2-owin-asp-net-identity/" target="_blank">here</a>, written by Taiseer Joudeh, which illustrate how to authenticate users in a Web API and <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> front end with a token-based approach. The token-based approach means that the server assigns a token to a validated user. The client saves the token and sends it with each request that the user makes to read or write data. This approach helps the client to share the server load in authentication, and the token is more simple to store than cookies.</p><p>After going through the tutorials, the next project was to use the knowledge gained by adding authentication to the PropertyManager Web application. I had to modify the Web API to add authentication, based on what was taught in the tutorials, by using ASP.NET Identity and Owin middleware packages in order to register new users and validate user credentials to generate tokens.</p><p>I learned how to use the Chrome Postman extension to verify after making the changes that it was not possible to access the API without first registering as a user and then obtaining a token to send with the GET or PUT to the API.</p><p>Then after verifying the the back end authentication was working, I added authentication to the front end. I added a login and registration screen to the front end of the PropertyManager Web application, along with a logout button and a display of the logged-in user. When trying to log in with the front end, I initially ran into some problems with <a href="http://enable-cors.org/index.html" target="_blank">Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</a>, as the default is that the API does not allow requests originating from a different domain. These problems did not occur when testing with Postman, as requests sent by Postman are not interpreted by the API as originating from a different domain, however requests from the front end are interpreted as being in a different domain. I made some changes in the API to allow CORS and was able to proceed with the front end changes.</p><p>I also learned more about how to validate in <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> by using components of the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/input" target="_blank">input</a> directive. Cameron explained to me that rather than disabling the submit button if a field is invalid, it is a better user experience to allow the user to complete their typing and click the button to submit, and only then to display any problems with the input data. I added validation logic to the login, register, and add property/tenant/lease screens, such that when the user submits the form, any required fields that have not been filled in are highlighted in red with a message underneath stating that they are required.</p><p>The guest speaker this week was Jim Milton from <a href="http://portfolium.com" target="_blank">Portfolium</a>, which is a site that allows you to build an online portfolio of projects. He explained the best ways to leverage our portfolios to make us more attractive to recruiters and prospective employers. Now I need to improve my portfolio according to his suggestions!</p><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/70/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/70/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=70&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>October 26 was the start of the sixth week at <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a>. I was amazed at the thought that at the end of the week, I would be halfway through! I couldn&#8217;t believe how much I had already learned in a relatively short time; I had started doing online courses in HTML/CSS/Javascript a few months ago, and now I was building full-stack Web applications!</p><p>Last week I built my front ends with <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html" target="_blank">KnockoutJS</a>, and this week it was time to learn about <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, which is also a framework for building Web applications, but so much more. It enables data binding between the data model and the view, so that when a variable&#8217;s value changes, it automatically changes on the Web page. <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> also enables breaking the application cleanly into modules that can be individually unit tested, and provides end-to-end testing functionality. There was definitely quite a bit of syntax to learn with <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>, but it appeared to me to offer a lot more capabilities than <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html" target="_blank">KnockoutJS</a>.</p><p>The first project in <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> was to build a Budget Tracker app, with a dynamic list of income entries and a list of expense entries, along with the sum of each, and the balance (amount left after total expenses are subtracted from total income). I thought it would be a nice touch to display the balance in red, yellow, or green, according to whether it was below zero, equal to zero, or above zero, so I learned about <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> directives involving conditional display, such as ng-if and ng-show, in order to do that.</p><p>Then I learned about <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps" target="_blank">Angular Google maps</a>, which is amazing; it enables <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> applications to display and use Google maps, a very useful thing for many applications. The assigned project for getting more familiar with using this was the ChipotleMapper, which uses <a href="http://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps" target="_blank">Angular Google maps</a> and the Origin Chipotle API written by our esteemed teacher Cameron. When a zip code is entered, the ChipotleMapper application gets a list of the nearest Chipotle applications from the API, and then displays a Google map with all the locations on it, as well as a list of the locations and their addresses under the map. This was a fun application to write, and it made me hungry for some Mexican food!</p><p>The next bit of <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> wisdom was the <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router" target="_blank">AngularJS UI Router</a>, which is a routing framework that enables a single-page Web application to have multiple views that are not actually separate Web HTML pages, so they don&#8217;t have to be reloaded every time My ears perked up when Cameron explained that the <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router" target="_blank">AngularJS UI Router</a> uses the concept of a state machine; this is a term that I had been familiar with in my telephony software development days. The next project was a resume application, with three views: Home, Portfolio, and Resume. The Home view has a short professional summary, the Portfolio view has a list of projects, and the Resume view has a resume with work history, education, etc.  This will come in handy in the upcoming job search!</p><p>Next, I learned about Entity Framework Code First,  which means that rather than building the back end database and tables in SQL, and then using Entity Framework to create the C# classes for it, I would write the C# classes first, and then use Entity Framework to create the database and tables. It was interesting to see this method, after using the method of building the database first in SQL. Then I learned about <a href="http://automapper.org/" target="_blank">AutoMapper</a>, which eases the drudgery of mapping between objects, and basically makes it easier to write the API methods that need to map between the object that is received from the database, and the object that is returned to the caller of the API method.</p><p>Finally, after building three front end applications, it was time to get back to full stack! After explaining line-of-business applications to us, the next project that Cameron assigned was a PropertyManager application, where we needed to use Entity Framework Code First to define and generate the tables, and then write the Web API, and then write the front end in <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a>. I wrote the code to generate the tables, and completed the Web API CRUD methods for each table, along with a basic unit test for each method, and I have completed some of the front end, and will do more of it over the weekend.</p><p>We had two great speakers this week. The first was Clint Johnson, a technical recruiter at Manpower Group. He gave us a lot of great advice on our resumes and the upcoming job search. The next speaker was Bryan Hall, the CTO and cofounder of <a href="https://emailcopilot.com" target="_blank">Email Copilot</a>. He also had a lot of good information on how to prepare ourselves to get hired and excel in our jobs!</p><p>Now that the sixth week has ended, I am halfway through this coding bootcamp adventure, and loving every minute of it, even when I struggle with problems and work until late at night, it&#8217;s all a great challenge that expands my mind!</p><p class="p1"><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/61/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/61/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=61&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>On October 19, I started the fifth week at Origin Code Academy. Over the weekend, I had completed the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html" target="_blank">Knockout JS</a> tutorials, which introduced the basic concepts of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html" target="_blank">Knockout JS</a> (JavaScript) . JavaScript is a scripting language used by Web pages, and <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html" target="_blank">Knockout JS</a> is a library of JavaScript functions that simplifies the implementation of Web page user interfaces, by allowing fields on the Web page to update automatically according to user action or changes to the data.</p><p>Cameron explained that <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html" target="_blank">Knockout JS</a> uses the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, which consists of the Model (application data such as back-end SQL tables), the View (HTML/CSS files for the web page structure), and the ViewModel (interface between the Model and the View, implemented by <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/index.html" target="_blank">Knockout JS</a> functions in this case).</p><p>Then it was time for the first project of the week, the Change Calculator that I had already done in C# as a Console and WPF application, but this time implemented as a Web application. It was a good way to become familiar with how to set up the necessary folders and files, and what tools can be used to make the process more efficient.</p><p>It is a little more complicated to set up the folders and files for a Web application, because there is some manual work involved. When I use Visual Studio to write a C# application, Visual Studio takes care of the folder structure, but with a Web application, I have to set up the folders and files myself. There has to be an index.html file, which contains the HTML that defines the structure of the Web page, CSS files that define the styling of elements on the Web page, and JavaScript files that contain the JavaScript that I write for the application ViewModel, as well as any JavaScript libraries that my application needs.</p><p>I learned how to use the <a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank">Bower</a> package management tool to automatically download files and place them in the appropriate folders, so I don&#8217;t have to manually download the files for each package that I want to use in my application. However after the files are downloaded, I still have to edit the index.html file to include them. There&#8217;s probably a way of automating that, I just have to find it!</p><p>I became more familiar with using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, which provides ready-made components that can be used on a Web page. This enables you to set up a Web page in a lot less time than if you had to write all the HTML/CSS for each element yourself. I was also pointed to <a href="https://bootswatch.com/" target="_blank">Bootswatch</a>, which provides themes to enable changing the look of a <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>-built Web page quickly and easily. I think it makes sense to use time-saving tools like these, as they help to get Web pages set up quickly and efficiently with standard components.</p><p>I did struggle a bit with my first Web project, the Change Calculator, as I had to put all the moving parts together: setting up the folder and files, designing the look of the Web page, setting up the HTML, getting used to Bootstrap, getting used to Knockout JS, etc. I also ran into the problem that JavaScript is not a strongly-typed language, so calculations with numbers can be problematic. This meant, for example, that a calculation that should have yielded 0.20, instead yielded 0.19999993! Cameron explained that to solve this problem, there are JavaScript math libraries that can be used in order to get precise calculations.</p><p>For the next project, Cameron taught us about the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/plugins-mapping.html" target="_blank">Knockout mapping plugin</a>, which is useful when fetching JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data from a server. The <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/plugins-mapping.html" target="_blank">Knockout mapping plugin</a> provides easy mapping of the JSON object to a JavaScript variable in the ViewModel, rather than writing code to manually parse it. He also showed us how to use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/" target="_blank">jQuery Ajax</a> requests to read Web data.</p><p>Armed with this knowledge, the next project was to build a Movie finder Web application, using the <a href="http://omdbapi.com" target="_blank">Open Movie Database API</a>. The database includes TV shows in addition to movies, so I built an application that enables searching for only movies, only TV shows, or both. I was starting to get more comfortable working with front-end design, and using Bootstrap and Bootswatch, as well as my own custom CSS file, to improve the look of the Web page.</p><p>Then it was finally time to work on the front end for the LargeBank API that I wrote last week, meaning that I would be completing a full-stack Web application and I would be a full-stack Web developer! I learned that it was necessary to make a change to the LargeBank API involving CORS (Cross Origin Request Security), in order to enable the Web application to use the LargeBank API to get access to the LargeBank database.</p><p>I got my LargeBank front end working, as a Web application showing a list of customers, and the ability to add or edit a customer. Although it appears that the adding/editing is done on a different Web page, it is actually the same Web page, with different parts showing according to what the application needs to do. This is called a single-page application, which usually provides a better user experience, as constant page reloads are not necessary. While doing this project, I learned to use the <a href="https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/" target="_blank">Toastr</a> JavaScript library, which provides simplified user notifications that are more attractive than using the JavaScript alert method.</p><p>Our guest speaker this week was Nicholas Head, the Director of Software Development at <a href="http://www.hireahelper.com/" target="_blank">HireaHelper</a>, a company that helps you to compare prices for moving companies, and book a truck or moving company. He is a self-professed computer nerd/geek, who started programming at a very young age, and has had a rewarding software development career without a college degree, although he was told in high school that was not possible. He gave us an overview of the software system at <a href="http://www.hireahelper.com/" target="_blank">HireaHelper</a>, explained the daily routine of a software developer, and advised us on how to become awesome software developers!</p><p>Then Cameron assigned us the weekend project, a full-stack Web project to implement a Guestbook that displays messages and allows new messages to be added. The project requirements including setting up the SQL database, writing the API for the database, including a unit test for each method, and building the front end with Knockout JS. I decided that my application would be for visitors to Iron Gym to leave comments about their awesome workouts!</p><p>I got the SQL database and the API including the unit tests done on Friday, and yesterday I started building the front end. This was the first project where I used images on the Web page, so that was a learning experience too, finding Websites with images that were either not copyrighted, or were licensed in a way that I could legally use them (e.g. Creative Commons licenses). I completed the basic functionality, along with adding some animation with the help of <a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/" target="_blank">animate.css</a>, but I still need to do some tweaks!</p><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/35/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/35/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=35&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>On October 12 the fourth week began. Over the weekend I had completed the SQL tutorials at <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-sql" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/" target="_blank">SQLZoo</a>, so I had written a lot of SQL queries and was ready to go! I struggled a bit with the more complex queries in <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/" target="_blank">SQLZoo</a> involving subqueries and joining tables, and I need to find some more tutorials to get more practice. I even had some previous knowledge of SQL, as in 2003 I attended an Information Systems course, where I learned about Windows 2000 and SQL, and then obtained the Microsoft certifications MCP, MCSE, and MCDBA. However, whatever knowledge I retained from that needs to be updated!</p><p>Cameron taught us about various implementations of SQL Server; the class is using Microsoft SQL Server, along with SQL Server Management Studio. I learned that CRUD does not mean what it sounds like! It means Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations that are needed to work with data. They map to the HTTP operations POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.</p><p>The first project was to write SQL queries to create tables for the LargeBank database, to hold information for customers, accounts, transactions, and statements. This project is the first step of a very exciting larger project where I get to build the back end SQL database, and then write an API to access it, and then write a front end that utilizes that API!</p><p>Next, I learned about using the Entity Framework to access the SQL tables, as an alternative to building SQL queries in C#. The Entity Framework is an ORM (Object Relational Mappers) that maps relational data to objects, so it is simpler to access the data in the SQL tables, but it involves some overhead, therefore it is slower for larger databases than simply building the SQL queries in C#. The next project was to write a C# application that uses the Entity Framework to access the SQL tables built in the previous project.This was getting better and better&#8230; I could use C# code to access the same SQL tables that I had built with SQL queries!</p><p>Then Cameron explained the basic concepts of REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs, how they should be designed and structured, and how to write them. The next assigned project was to use the ASP.Net Web API in C# to write the API for the previously built LargeBank database. There were a lot of new concepts here, and luckily Cameron has been recording his lectures, because I needed to watch his lecture again, and continually pause it to perform the actions that he was explaining, in order to get started writing my API!</p><p>The &#8220;bonus&#8221; this week (not sure who else saw it as a bonus) was that I learned how to write Unit Tests in Visual Studio! The reason for learning this was that a Web browser can be used to test the API GET methods to verify that they are working, but since a Web browser does only GET, and doesn&#8217;t do PUT, POST, or DELETE, it was necessary to find another way to test those API methods.</p><p>Once again I had to rewatch the lecture where Cameron taught how to write the test methods, and keep pausing it to get my Unit Tests started, but after rewatching, I managed to get my first tests working. It was really a challenge to understand how to interpret the structure of the HTTP results of the API methods, in order to properly verify them in the test methods, but after some struggling, I was able to add enough tests to have a basic test method for each API method. I had to get Cameron&#8217;s help for one where i was stuck, but for another one, I was able to figure out the problem myself! I can see that writing complete tests to cover every basic case and error case would be a time consuming, but necessary part of software development.</p><p>This week&#8217;s guest speaker was Neal Bloom from <a href="https://hired.com/" target="_blank">hired.com</a>, and he was very optimistic about our prospects in the job market. He said that we are learning skills that employers are looking for, such as .NET, C#, Javascript, using APIs, writing APIs, etc. I liked hearing that!</p><p>The weekend assignment was to complete the tutorials at <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">Knockout JS</a>  in order to prepare for&#8230; front end!</p><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/26/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/26/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=26&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>October 5 marked the start of the third week in <a href="http://origincodeacademy" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a>. This was the week where it started getting real; I learned how to use APIs (Application Programming Interfaces, basically a set of functions provided by the developers of web-based software). You can build apps that use APIs to show weather forecasts, stock prices, map locations, etc.</p><p>I learned how to use the C# WebClient class in order to read data from a Web URL, and also learned about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which is the format of the data returned by the APIs that we were using. XML (Extensible Markup Language) is an alternative way for APIs to return data, but JSON is simpler to work with, so the class used only APIs that worked with JSON. I learned how to deserialize or parse the returned JSON data in order to obtain the data from the result provided by the API.</p><p>This week we did pair programming for the first two projects. I was assigned to work with Adriann, which was a very good choice. We get along nicely, and we complement each other&#8217;s skill sets and strengths very well.</p><p>The first project was to use the GitHub API to get data for a particular GitHub user. It was a challenge to understand how to read the API documentation, and to figure out from the documentation how to build the necessary Web URL, but after some trial and error, we got it done!</p><p>The next project was to build a WPF project to use the Weather Underground API to show weather forecasts. This is where Adriann&#8217;s strengths in front end really shined. That WPF app looks great, thanks to her! The project had an optional extra, to display the appropriate icon according to the weather (e.g. sun icon if sunny, cloud icon if cloudy, etc.). When we looked at the data returned by the API, we saw that it was providing an icon URL, so we did the project extra by using the icon URL to download the icon image file and display it on our app. Cameron really liked our idea, and passed it on to the other students! So we were proud that we gave him a good idea!</p><p>Another project was to find an API that provides stock prices, and then build a &#8220;High Frequency Trading&#8221; app that advises whether to buy or sell. (I used double quotes because Cameron took great pains to remind us that the method we were using was not a real algorithm that would make anybody any money, and would more likely cause somebody to lose all their money!) One challenge was that since we were on the West coast, we would only be able to get live stock prices until 2pm, and after that the price wouldn&#8217;t change, so we wouldn&#8217;t be able to test all of our code paths until the next morning. I didn&#8217;t want to wait for that, so I put in some test code, which used a counter to make the stock price higher, lower, or stay the same, according to the counter&#8217;s divisibility by 2 or 3. After I was able to test fully, I removed the code. i did make sure to test again the next morning with live data!</p><p>The last project was a good illustration of adding a new feature to existing software. I had to take the Contacts app that I built in week 2, and add a new screen to it, to require authentication via a verification code sent by text message. I used the <a href="https://www.twilio.com/api" target="_blank">Twilio API</a> to send the text message. This was really a lot of fun, because of course like anybody else, I have seen many applications in the real world that send a code via text message that you have to enter in order to continue, so it was great to have the chance to see it from the other side.</p><p>This week&#8217;s guest speaker was William Stegner, the CTO of Factor Technologies Inc. He has interviewed and hired bootcamp students, and trained junior developers, so he had some good practical advice on how to prepare for the eventual job search, and how to convince prospective employers of our value.</p><p>Cameron assigned SQL tutorials for the weekend, so that means databases next week!</p><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/19/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/19/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=19&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>September 28 was the start of the second week at <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a>, and I was ready to learn more!</p><p>In the first week I had been working on Console applications, which are similar to command line windows, or DOS (if that means anything to anybody reading this!), where the application output and the user input are typed on lines, with no graphic user interface. In the second week, I learned how to create WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) applications, which have graphic user interfaces with buttons, text boxes, etc.</p><p>I also learned object-oriented programming concepts, which are a building block in the C# language. They provide the means to encapsulate logic and break up software into manageable chunks, so if one part has to be modified, it should not adversely affect all the other parts.</p><p>The first project of the week was a way to become more familiar with WPF applications; I took the Change Calculator that I built last week as a Console application, and redid it as a WPF application. That was interesting, because a big part of that application had been how to validate the user input. The input validation in WPF applications works differently than in Console applications, and I had to figure out the different handling in order to be able to do the project.</p><p>For the next project, the Notepad application, I learned how to handle reading/writing files, and how to open Windows dialog boxes. For the Journal application, I learned how to use the DataGrid control to display rows of data. For the Contacts application, I learned how to open a new WPF window, and pass data between the WPF windows.</p><p>Sometimes when I saw the project assignment, I was not sure how to do it, but I would break down the problem into smaller pieces, and that helped me to find the solution. As always, <a href="http://stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">stack overflow</a> and our awesome teacher Cameron Wilby were assets!</p><p>The guest speaker on Friday was Michael Roberts Jr., who works for <a href="http://www.zeeto.io" target="_blank">Zeeto</a> as a senior developer. It was a great opportunity to hear about his career path, and the daily life of a software developer.</p><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/14/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/14/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=14&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>I walked into the first day of class on September 21 ready to start learning, not sure what would happen but optimistic that it would all work. The other coding bootcamp students were strangers, but we were about to get to know each other and work together for the next 12 weeks.</p><p>Our teacher Cameron Wilby got down to brass tacks fairly quickly. He taught us about Agile development with Scrum, which is a method of project management. We&#8217;ll be using the Trello tool, and each week in the bootcamp will be a Scrum sprint. He also reviewed the use of <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git </a>and <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, which we had learned about in the course prepwork, and are methods for distributed version source control of software. These methodologies are widely used in software development, so it&#8217;s good that we&#8217;ll get experience using them.</p><p>We also learned about good coding principles, including the DRY principle (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself, which means writing modular reusable code). We also learned about principles in problem solving. Cameron said he will teach us how to code but also teach us how to learn, which is very important since the technology is constantly changing, and it&#8217;s always necessary to keep skills updated and learn a new framework or language.</p><p>When we started learning about C# and Visual Studio, there was a lot to take in, but I felt that my previous software development helped me in understanding how to write the code; and the recent experience with online coding courses also didn&#8217;t hurt! It took a lot of concentration but also felt very rewarding.</p><p>Before I knew it, I was coding my first project, an Age Calculator to calculate the age in years, months, and days from a birthday. This was a good introduction to the DateTime class! Each day we learned more C# concepts and then got a new project where we could use those concepts, which helped in really getting them into my brain. Learning by doing is a great way to reinforce concepts.</p><p>The other projects for the week were a Tile Calculator, which outputs the area to tile and the total price, given the area dimensions and the size and price of the tile; a Change Calculator, which outputs the appropriate amounts of each type of coin and bill to give; and a Mortgage Calculator, which outputs the mortgage payment information. The lessons and projects are on GitHub, and we use GitHub to store our projects, which gives us good practice in using GitHub.</p><p>I always managed to complete the projects, but often needed to research questions on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stack overflow</a>, a great resource where developers ask questions that are answered by other developers. I am in awe of the collective wisdom gathered on that website! If I couldn&#8217;t figure it out from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">stack overflow</a>, then I kept trying on other sites, or consulted with other students, or I asked our awesome teacher for help.</p><p>Week one accomplished&#8230; on to week two!</p><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/9/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/9/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=9&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>

                <![CDATA[<p>Why did I decide to take the plunge and move across the country to start attending <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a> on September 21, 2015 in San Diego, California? <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy </a>is a 12-week intensive coding bootcamp that teaches the skills needed to work as a software developer, mainly in the field of Web applications. They also offer guaranteed job placement. To explain the reasons for my decision, I need to go back a bit&#8230;</p><p>Some time ago, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science-Mathematics, and then worked as a software developer, mainly in telecommunications. My job at Siemens in Boca Raton, Florida gave me the opportunity to work for Siemens in Munich, Germany (great location for visiting Italy, Switzerland, Austria, etc.!) After that, I moved to Tel Aviv, Israel, where my job was more focused on testing and QA, still in telecommunications.</p><p>Due to an economic downturn, the project I was working on was terminated, and I was laid off. I considered moving back to the U.S., but really wanted more time in Israel. After a few twists and turns, I ended up working as a technical writer at <a href="http://www.rad.com/" target="_blank">RAD Data Communications</a>, where I worked with wonderful people who I still miss. It was interesting work, but whenever I met with developers to get information for the documentation, I felt a faint twinge that they were doing the type of work that I used to do.</p><p>A few months ago, I finally decided to move back to the U.S. from Tel Aviv. It was difficult to leave after so many years there, but my parents weren&#8217;t getting any younger, and I felt I shouldn&#8217;t be so far away. (OK, I am now on a different coast from them, but still closer than Israel!)</p><p>When I returned to the U.S., I thought I would continue to work as a technical writer. As I started applying for technical writer positions, I noticed job listings for API technical writers, who produce the documentation for APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) , which are basically a set of functions that developers use to interface with Web-based software applications. I thought that I would like working as an API technical writer, as I would get to write about really exciting technology, and would be that much closer to the code.  (I actually signed up for an API technical writing workshop to be held at Google NYC headquarters on September 21, but as that was the first day of classes at <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a>, I was not able to attend!)</p><p>The job listings for API technical writers specified the ability to read and understand code, so I started doing online courses for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I really enjoyed the courses, especially the coding exercises. Then I saw an article about coding bootcamps, and I started to think that I would much rather write the APIs than document them, and a coding bootcamp could be my way to return to development.</p><p>The article mentioned <a href="http://www.appacademy.io/" target="_blank">App Academy</a>, which has a job guarantee and a branch in New York City, a good location since I was living on Long Island (with my wonderful mother who had the patience and kindness to put up with me all those months!). It was a long shot, since the <a href="http://www.appacademy.io/" target="_blank">App Academy</a> website states that their acceptance rate is less than 5%, but I decided to try. In order to apply, I had to spend some time learning the Ruby language, then doing practice exercises, and then doing a 45-minute coding challenge. I completed all the exercises in the allotted time, but I was informed that they would not be moving forward with my application. I was disappointed, but learning Ruby and doing the coding was a good learning experience, and confirmed to me that I would really like to code.</p><p>I continued to do online coding courses and read as much as I could about coding bootcamps, especially on the helpful website <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/" target="_blank">Course Report</a>. I knew that I wanted a bootcamp with a job guarantee, as I did not want to be in the situation of spending thousands of dollars on the tuition and then having no job at the end of the bootcamp. I could not find any other bootcamps in the NYC area with a job guarantee, so I realized that I would probably have to move to a different area in order to go to a bootcamp, which would add the cost of room and board to the tuition, a daunting thought, but I felt that it would be worth it as an investment in my future.</p><p>My search for coding bootcamps with job guarantees led to <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a> in the San Diego area and  <a href="http://codinghouse.co" target="_blank">Coding House</a> in the San Francisco bay area. I really liked the curriculum at <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a>, but their cohort was starting September 21, which meant I would have to fly back after the first week of class to attend my niece&#8217;s wedding on September 26 in New York (some of my family members thought I was crazy to even consider going to <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a> because of that). On the other hand, the next <a href="http://codinghouse.co" target="_blank">Coding House</a> cohort was starting October 26, so there would be no conflict with attending the wedding, and they include housing and food for an additional fee, so I would not need to look for housing, but they have a low acceptance rate.</p><p>I had phone interviews with both bootcamps, and in the interview with Jeff Winkler, one of the co-founders of <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a>, he was smart enough to spot a good thing, and offered me a place in the cohort! In the interview with <a href="http://codinghouse.co" target="_blank">Coding House</a>, I was informed that I should do more coding challenges in order to proceed. I decided that logistical problems should not stand in the way of fulfilling my dream of going back to development, and that I would rather have my own space than live in dormitory-style accommodations.</p><p>After that it was a whirlwind of booking flights and finding a place to live, and in that I have to thank Cameron Wilby, also a co-founder of <a href="http://origincodeacademy.com" target="_blank">Origin Code Academy</a>, as well as being our fantastic teacher, who sent me the link to <a href="https://vantaggiosuites.com/" target="_blank">Vantaggio Suites</a>, which is a bit like living in a student dorm, and the wifi isn&#8217;t always great, but I have my own furnished room with a mini fridge and microwave, and I can walk to class in under 15 minutes.</p><p>It wasn&#8217;t easy to leave everything behind, but it&#8217;s not the first time that I&#8217;ve moved to a new area. I am learning new things every day, expanding my abilities, meeting difficult challenges, and I am totally loving it!</p><br /><a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/2/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/kdssnyder.wordpress.com/2/" /></a><img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=kdssnyder.wordpress.com&#038;blog=101346606&#038;post=2&#038;subd=kdssnyder&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]>
